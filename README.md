# CapstoneProject--Yarned Over
 My project for capstone.
 This project includes an educational platform on how to crochet certain products out of yarn. The website is built with html, CSS, and Javascript. So far what I have created is a simple site with a header, body and footer with HTML. The site will have responsive features such as flipping cards and a button with a pop-up. There are some CSS styling included as of now.  Additionally the platform will include and API that features a randomly generated crocheting project with the assitance of Node.JS.
