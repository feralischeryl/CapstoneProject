# CapstoneProject
 My project for capstone
 This is my static-type website. It is responsive and educational. The website has been developed for a llama farm that creates yarn. The website features a navigation bar with an gradient background with opacity set at 30%. There is an about section that describes the farm and website. There is flip-cards that feature crocheting projects that range from levels easy to hard. The random project generator has not been created just yet nor the donation button has a reaction. Will continue to improve and work on this.
